-- Required by the dbt Semantic Layer / MetricFlow whenever a semantic model
-- uses a `type: time` dimension (see order_date in _semantic_models.yml).
-- This is a generic date spine, not business data — it doesn't depend on
-- any other model and just needs to cover the full range dates in
-- fct_orders could ever fall in.
